INSTALL : git clone https://github.com/D4wZ7z/Searcher-/

## Introduction

Fast Searcher is a 💻Python💻 🛠️tool🛠️ designed to perform searches similar to `grep -r` or `ripgrep` in the Linux terminal. 🕵️‍♂️Hackers🕵️‍♂️ often utilize such commands to scour through databases and find information. However, dealing with large databases, sometimes up to 1 terabyte in size, can lead to excessively long search times. To mitigate this issue, ⚡️Fast Searcher⚡️ was developed to provide faster search capabilities.

## Usage Instructions

Before proceeding with the installation of the required Python modules, ensure that you have placed your 📁 database 📁 in the `DB` folder. Sub-folders within the 📁 DB folder 📁 are also supported; Fast Searcher will search through all directories recursively.

⚠️Important information⚠️: You need to create a folder called "DB" so that the searcher detects the DB folder and searches for people in your db.

To begin the installation process:

1. Click on the 📜`module_install.bat`📜file to install the essential Python modules required for the searcher.
