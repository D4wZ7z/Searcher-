Here's the searcher I created.

The aim of my searcher is equivalent to grep -r or ripgrep in the linux terminal. Hackers often find you thanks to the DB and type the grep -r command to do so.

 but since most of them have large databases of up to 1to, the search time is very long, which is why I created my fast searcher.

-----------------------------------Instruction-----------------------------------
BEFORE STARTING THE PROCEDURE TO INSTALL THE SEARCHER'S REQUIRED PYTHON MODULES, YOU NEED TO PUT YOUR "DATABASE" IN THE üìÅFOLDERüìÅ
DB

(If there are sub-folders it doesn't matter, it'll find everything)


Please click on the .bat file (module_install) which is used to install the essential modules for the python searcher.

after installing the modules, click on the file (Start)

And that's it, have fun!
